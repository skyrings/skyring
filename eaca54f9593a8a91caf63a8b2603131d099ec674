      "message": "Is this like every skyring restart, file is overwritten with a new key? And why do we need 600? even if root was to edit, it is anyway rewritten on restart and user modified key would probably never be picked up. I think we could either give 400 permission. Or if we choose to allow user to have a key(most likely not), we should probably generate it once probably during skyring-setup only and use every other time.Please correct me if I am wrong.",
