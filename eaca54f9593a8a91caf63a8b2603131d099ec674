That\u0027s the reason the permissions is 600 and not 400.\nUser should not decide the keys and skyring randomly creates a key to encrypt data. Its good to randomly create key everytime as personally I feel its safe because event if somebody somehow cracks the key once, if server is restarted, the old key is of no use :)",
