      "message": "As we had discussed before, this seems to be a dead code. You can remove it. And there\u0027s an issue here that the updated at always remains empty as its never initialized to time.Now().String().\n\nSo, as part of this patch I think it would be nice if you fix it before we start depending on it somewhere.\n\nSo, ideally according to me, what you could do is, intialize storageUsageTimeStamp to value existing already(in db probably using something like node.Utilizations[\"storageusage\"].UpdatedAt) and then if utilizations of all osds from processing node are available, update it to time.Now().String().\n\nAnd finally as it is currently you\u0027ll use storageUsageTimeStamp to update the UpdatedAt field\n\n\n@Shubhendu, Is this ok?",

      "message": "Anmol, what would be deafult value coming from DB first time? a blank string?\nIf I understand correct, the data available means, all three fields valid data and that time you want it to be set as time.Now(). This seems fine to me. \nThis way next time on-wards DB as well would have valid time value and if new data points available we would that with current time.\n\nLooks fine to me..",
