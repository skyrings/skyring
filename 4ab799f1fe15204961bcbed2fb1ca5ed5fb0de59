      "message": "Yes the order is implicit here because it is ordered.\n\n1. I want to be able to extend this to sort a random list of units and values in ascending and descending orders however, I am not able to think of its applicability in our case as of now. But I have the sort related interface methods like Len(), Less() and Swap() implemented.\n\n2. Actually I think its not good to enforce the user to have to order the units in the list.This is a comment that someone in ovirt community had given me when I had submitted my patch there.\n\n3. Unavoidably I need to do it only in case of line 66. I am thinking if its really required.",
