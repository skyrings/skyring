But please correct me if I am wrong and enlighten me about the negative implications of this approach.\n\nI was basically imagining about the following approach ehile writing this code.\n1. Every command is mapped to a tag indicating its purpose.\n2. Every task is an collection of one or more of these tags\n   (representing sub-tasks)\n3. USMs job then would to figure out the sequence of events \n   to achieve the user requested tasks.\n4. Off-course at the end of execution of commands mapped to \n   each of the tags in the collection the corresponding   \n   results in form of json would be passed back to USM which \n   will be handled in custom fashion(may not be generic)\n\nBut this was my dreasm :)) not sure to what extent this is achievable although :D",
